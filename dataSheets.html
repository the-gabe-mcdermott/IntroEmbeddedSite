<h2>What is a datasheet?</h2>

<p>
If you are working with a microcontroller and ask yourself “How do I do that?”, 
its time to refer to the datasheet. A datasheet is a technical manual that explains
all the properties and parts of a microcontroller, and how to use them.
It is usually available free of charge through the manufacture’s website as a PDF. 
A datasheet can be a daunting document, but if you have a question a microcontroller, 
it is almost guaranteed to be in there. 
</p>

<h2> Why Bother With a Datasheet When I Have the Internet?</h2>
<p>
Comparing Stack Ov-- I mean, internet forums, to the datasheet is a bit like comparing 
a car troubleshooting Wiki with the owners manual. The Wiki can be useful if 
you want a quick overview; but it won’t have all the details, 
and it will only be <i> mostly </i> accurate. The owners manual 
will describe your specific car in much greater detail, making it 
easier to understand how it works, which will make debugging easier overall.
The datasheet is also less likely to contain statements, code, or examples 
that are bad style, dangerous, or downright wrong. 
The datasheet can be wrong sometimes, but it will have a much
better track record than internet forums will.
</p>

<p>
When debugging, It can be tempting to reach for the Internet to find a 
code snippet, or quick explanation that solves your problem, 
and I’m not saying that isn’t valid. However if you can’t find your 
answer from google after five minutes, it's probably a good point to 
start investing your time reading an in-depth resource that will 
definitely have the information you need, instead of investing time
 on a broad, surface level resource that might not ever tell you what 
 you need. Both research tactics are valid tools, just know when 
 to use one or the other. 
</p>

<h2> What Kind of Information is in a Datasheet? </h2>

<p>
In short, the datasheet tells how to write your software to make the microcontroller do what you want it to do. If you want to know how to set a pin to a “1” to make an attached LED turn on, the datasheet will tell you what register your software needs to write to make that happen. If you want to set a hardware timer to notify your software on every half second, the datasheet tells you how to do that.
</p>

<p>
The datasheet will also describe the microcontrollers physical properties, like how much current it provides out of its pins, how much power it typically uses, and other electrical properties. It will tell you recommended clock speeds, recommended operating temperatures, and lots of other details. 
</p>

<h2>Microcontroller Datasheets Versus Development Board Datasheets</h2>

<p>
Typically there will be a datasheet for the microcontroller and a separate datasheet for the development board. If you are not sure what the difference is, a Development board is the name for a piece of circuit board you order from the manufacturer. The board will have the microcontroller soldered onto it, in addition to a power plug, a power indication light, plastic pin headers for easily connecting jumper cables to the controller, and usually some other extra features like a small display, or a few push buttons.
</p>

<p>
Technically, the microcontroller is the small black piece of silicon at the center of the development board. The microcontroller on its own, un-soldered from the board, would be fairly useless without the additional power supply circuitry, sensors, and other parts to support it.
</p>

<p>
The reason the development board exist is to allow engineers to try out a microcontroller to make prototypes.  All the hard work designing circuitry for the power supply, buttons, and other general features are already done, so engineers can focus on making their prototype. After making a prototype, the next step is to design their own circuit board to replace the development board.  While the development board’s built-in general features made prototyping easy, the new board will be designed specifically for the new product. It will have fewer parts (cheaper to mass-produce), take up less space, and use less power. The engineer then places a bulk order for hundreds of thousands (or however many) of the selected microcontroller and other parts, and sets an assembly line to work creating the Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and soldering on the components.
</p>

<p>
Which is why the Microcontroller datasheet, and the development board data sheet are different. The microcontroller sheet describes properties of the microcontroller itself, number of pins and safe operating voltages, in addition to instructions on proper use of sub-systems of the microcontroller, like timers, interrupts, and other parts I will describe later in this book.  
</p>

<p>
The Development Board datasheet describes the properties of the development board. It may detail what pins on the microcontroller are hooked up to the headers (and what pins are not), size of on-board storage, speed of the clock chip included on the board, and other details specific to the development board.
</p>
 

<h2>How Do I Read a Datasheet?</h2>

<p>
This may seem like a silly question at first, but it becomes valid at 2:30 am when you just need to figure out why your hardware timer isn’t running like it should, and you’ve Stack Overflow scouring just makes things more confusing. Next thing you now, you are staring at five hundred pages of dense technical manual, with no clue how to find the small needle-like detail hidden inside the haystack of timing diagrams, register tables, and detailed explanation of power profiles. 
</p>

<p>
Here is how you read a datasheet.
</p>

<p>
Start with the table of contents. Skim for the section on the part of the microcontroller you are interested in, say for example, timers. While you are here, keep an eye for any other parts that might be useful if your chosen section doesn’t have the info you need.
</p>

<p>
Next go the part of the book you picked from the table of contents. Skim the section, looking for mention your part. This is where a search function in your PDF reader would come in handy. If the section isn’t useful, skip to the next section you picked from the table of contents.
</p>

<p>
Say you come across the info you need right away. You find out that your microcontroller has two timer systems called tmr1 and tmr2, and that to start tmr1, write a “1” to the address “0xF00089A4”. 
</p>

<p>
The next step is to keep skimming the datasheet. Even though you found the data you wanted. A microcontroller is a complex machine with many interconnected logical parts. Sometimes there are other parts that need to be set up properly in order for the microcontroller to work the way you expect. In the timer example, continuing to skim through timer related sections of the datasheet might reveal that in order for tmr1 or tmr2 to operate, a “1”  needs to be written to their enable registers. Even if the timer is turned on by the register set at first, nothing will happen unless this other register is set as well. If you didn’t continue skimming the datasheet, you wouldn’t know this, and you would be left wondering why the timer didn’t work, even though you did exactly as the first part of the datasheet told you to. This is not an uncommon occurrence. Skim your datasheet. All of it. All of the parts relevant to your project at least. The hour or so of up-front research may save you several hours of pointless frustration later. 
</p>

<h2>Other Datasheet Tips</h2>

<p>
I recommend getting a PDF copy of the datasheet that has annotation permissions, so you can make notes in your datasheet for your own reference. This can be useful to bookmark parts you use often, leave comments about “gotchas” you discovered that future you may forget, or to record corrections to errors you may find in the datasheet (It does happen).
</p>

<p>
Slightly tangential, a dedicated lab notebook can also be useful for this reason. Having a place to write down a long address (i.e. “0xF00047F1”) instead of memorizing it, or looking it up every time, can be extremely valuable.
