<h1>Crash Course in Circuits</h1>

<p>
This section is a quick introduction to electricity basics. 
</p>

<h2>What is a Circuit?</h2>

<p>
A circuit is a closed loop of conductive material that electrons flow through;
That's why it is called a circuit. Usually, engineers build circuits to use 
the energy of these electrons racing around the track 
to do some kind of useful work. Electrical energy can 
be used to drive motors, power lights, and perform all 
sorts of tasks. Electrical energy can also be used to
represent a value, or a <strong> logic level </strong>,
where one energy level represents a "1", and another
energy level represents a "0". This can be used for
transmitting information across a wire, and fed as
inputs into <strong> logic gates </strong> to get a 
predictable output. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout this chapter, I will use the term electrical component, or simply component, to generically refer to gizmos wired into a circuit.
</p>

<h2> Four Properties of Circuits </h2>

<p>
There are four concepts you will need to understand in order to do basic work with circuits. These four concepts are:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Voltage</li>
	<li>Current</li>
	<li>Power</li>
	<li>Resistance</li>
</ol>

<h2>Voltage</h2>

<p>
We get the electrons to go around the track by creating what is called an 
<strong>electric potential</strong> otherwise known as <strong>voltage</strong>.
Electric Potential is a difference in electric potential energy. 
It is a lot like a ski lift, bringing skiers up a mountain to a
 position of high gravitational potential energy. 
 The rest of the circuit then, is the ski run, with electrons racing down,
 moving to achieve the lowest energy state possible. 
 Just like skiers being pulled by gravity down a mountain, the electric 
 force pulls electrons from a place of high electric potential to a 
 place of lower electric potential. 
</p>

<p>
We call this lowest electric potential state <strong>ground</strong>. Ground is is the place where the potential energy of the electrons is zero. That isn‚Äôt to say they don‚Äôt have any energy at all. It means within the closed loop of the circuit, they have reached the ‚Äúlowest‚Äù place, they have no further motivation to move around the circuit; Remember that voltage is is simply the difference between electrons in a ‚Äúhigh place‚Äù (High electric potential) that want to fall to a ‚Äúlow place‚Äù (low electric potential).
</p>

<p>
Voltage is measured between two points. It is a ‚ÄúDifference‚Äù between two places. Between a ‚Äúhigh place‚Äù and a ‚Äúlow place‚Äù. 
</p>

<p>
When someone says a part is a ‚Äú5 volt part‚Äù they mean it is meant to operate with a difference of 5 volts between the positive and negative terminals of the part.
</p>

<p>
When someone measures the voltage of a wire someplace in the circuit, and claims it is 7.32 Volts, they mean that part of the circuit has 7.32 Volts more than ground, or the ‚Äúlowest place‚Äù in the circuit. Remember that voltage without two points is meaningless.
</p>

<p>
Voltage is usually represented in equations with the letter ‚ÄúV‚Äù, it is measured in Volts.  
</p>

<h2>Current</h2>

<p>
Current is a measure of the rate of electrons flowing through a particular part of the circuit. 
</p>

<p>
An easy way to visualize current is to envision standing by a river. A river with a high current has a large torrent of water rushing past. A river with a low current lazily flows past. 
</p>

<p>
The unit for current is Amps. I or A are also both common shorthand to refer to current. It can also described with the following equation where ‚ÄúQ‚Äù represents the amount of electric charge (or electrons in simpler, but less accurate terms):
</p>

<!-- TODO: Generate an image for equations -->
<pre>
I = delta Q/delta t 
</pre>

<p>
Or change in electric charge over some period of time, (usually 1 second).
</p>


<h3>No Current? No Power.</h3>

<p>
Since current is a measure of the actual flow of electrons, measuring current is an important step in determining if an electrical circuit is ‚Äúon‚Äù. Remember that electricity is described by two parts, voltage and current. A circuit can have a large amount of voltage (electric potential energy), but without current (electron flow), there is not electricity. The high voltage provides a high potential for electricity, but alone is not electricity. This relationship between voltage and current is called <strong> electrical power </strong>, which I will describe later in this section. 
</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>
All components have a range of currents they will work in. Take an LED for example. If given insufficient current, it won‚Äôt light up. If given too much current, it will break. It is important to ensure all components in a system receive current within their safe operating range. 
</p>

<h2>Power</h2>

<p>
Electrical Power measures of the rate of electrical energy being used to do work over time. It is dependent upon two factors: the rate of electrons flowing (current), and the electrical potential energy they expend as they flow (voltage). 
</p>
<p>
Electrical power is measured in the unit Watts or W for shorthand, and the variable used is "P". It can be found with the following equations:
</p>

<pre>
P = (V*Q)/T

P = VI
</pre>

<p>
The equation above helps show that power in a circuit is due to the voltage and the current together.
</p>
 
<p>
For example, if a microcontroller is hooked up to a circuit with a fixed voltage of 2.5 volts, and very little current flows through it 0.1 mA, it is using a small amount of power.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
(0.1 mA) * (2.5 v) = 0.25 mW
</pre>
</code>

<p>
If the current increases to 5 mA, the power level of the microcontroller goes up.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
(5 mA) * (2.5 v) = 12.5 mW
</pre>
</code>

<h2>Resistance</h2>

<p>
Resistance is a measure of resistance to electron flow through a wire or component. It is measured in Ohms (Œ©), and commonly represented by the letter R. The following equation describes resistance behavior.
</p>

<pre>
V/I = R
</pre>

<p>
Nearly everything electrons flow through has some amount of resistance. Wires and other conductive materials have a very low resistance, while air, plastics, and other stuff have very high resistance. Electrons will want to follow the path of least resistance to reach the lowest potential energy state possible. So when given the option between a low resistance path like a wire, and a high resistance path like the air around a wire, the electrons will pick the wire. 
</p>

<p>
Resistance is important, because most components we wire into circuits to do work have some resistance associated with them. Yet other devices are only designed to handle a certain amount of voltage or current safely, and so parts called resistors can be used to resist the electrical flow, and alter the current flow and voltage level of the whole circuit so the sensitive part can be used safely. 
</p>
