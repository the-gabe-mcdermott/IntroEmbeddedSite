                                The #define keyword was briefly explained in the
                                preprocessor directive section. To review, 
                                anytime the preprocessor encounters the identifier
                                given after the #define in the code, it cut and pastes
                                the defined code snippet in its place. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This can be used to substitute in values.
                            </p>

                            <div class="codeExample">

                                This can also be used to substitute in multiple
                                lines of code.
                            </p>

                                Even better, you can write a #define to take parameters
                                like a function call would. Taking the variables given
                                and assigning them in the code pasted in.

                            <h2> Macros v Functions</h2>
                            <p>
                                Macros look similar to functions. But they behave 
                                in very different ways. To understand the difference,
                                you need to know how function calls are turned into assembly
                                and how that assembly interacts with memory.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Overview of Function Call Mechanics</h3>
                            <h4> Ordinary Operation</h4>
                            <p>
                                When you are executing your compiled code,
                                assembly instructions are loaded into the
                                CPU instruction register and another register 
                                called the program counter steadily ticks higher,
                                counting off assembly instructions already performed.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The instruction in the instruction register is 
                                performed, with variables serving as operands
                                and the results stored in general purpose registers, anywhere 
                                from 2 to 32 other registers, depending on architecture.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Anytime the processor loads an assembly instruction
                                that is a function call, something different happens.
                            </p>

                            <h4>When A Function Call is Encountered</h4>
                            <p>
                                The code inside the function call will need to use the
                                general purpose registers to do its thing, but the
                                code that called the function is currently using them to store 
                                its own variables.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To handle this, the data in all the registers is saved into memory in
                                the stack. Now, the function about to be called can use the registers.
                                When it is done, it will politely retrieve that data from the stack
                                and put back into the registers, allowing the original function to 
                                continue, business as usual. 
                            </p>
                            
<div class="codeExample">

void OrderCartons(uint16_t numberOfEggs);
void SendOrderSignal(uint16_t numberOfCartons);

int main(void)
{
	uint8_t numberOfChickens = 8;
	uint8_t numberOfEggs = 0;
	
	uint16_t expectedEggsPerChicken = 3;
	
	//General purpose registers are used to hold variables
	//Currently in use.
	numberOfEggs += numberOfChickens * expectedEggsPerChicken;
	
	//A function call causes all gernal purpose registers to be
	//saved to the stack.
	OrderCartons(numberOfEggs);
	
	//Since variable data was loaded back into 
	//general purpose registers after the 
	//function call,  can be used normally.
	printf("%d",numberOfEggs);
	return 0;
}

void OrderCartons(uint16_t numberOfEggs)
{
	const uint16_t eggsInACarton = 12;
	uint16_t numberOfCartonsToOrder = 0;
	
	//The function uses the general purpose registers
	//the same way main does.
	numberOfCartonsToOrder = numberOfEggs/eggsInACarton;
	
	SendOrderSignal(numberOfCartonsToOrder);
	
	//Before exiting, main's variable data is loaded from the stack
	//and back into the general purpose registers.
	//Any data in the registers used by this function is lost
	//as the function "exits scope".

                            <h2>Macros v Functions Recap</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                So functions have a overhead associated with them,
                                extra instructions that save register data on the 
                                stack and later retries it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Macros, on the other hand, have no such overhead.
                                They are a instructions to the preprocessor
                                to cut and paste a chunk of code directly into another chunk.
                            </p>

                       
                            <h3>Why Use a Macro Over a Function </h3>

                            <p>
                                Function calls have a small amount of overhead
                                associated with them. Saving all the registers takes
                                time. It doesn't take a lot of time, but it takes 
                                some time. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                               The time cost could become significant if the code
                                in question will be executed many times during the 
                                program operation. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Macros are also generally used in Interrupts, which is covered
                                in the Interrupts chapter.
                            </p>

                            
                            <h3>Why NOT to Use a Macro Over a Function </h3>

                            <p>
                                Macros cut and paste the code they contain
                                everywhere the preprocessor sees the identifier.
                                If the identifier is found in the file in twenty 
                                separate places, the macro code will be pasted
                                into each of those places. If the macro pastes
                                6 lines of code into each place, this will 
                                add an extra 100 instructions of C code to the file.
                                (6 instructions added per macro x 20 macro 
                                occurrences)  - 20  macro occurrences removed = 100.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the microcontroller has limited space to store
                                instructions, this could pose a problem. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Another cost associated with macros is the added compile time.
                                The more the macro is used, the longer the code will take
                                to compile. Long compile times are obnoxious to developers, sure,
                                but will legitimately slow down development and debugging time.
                                And developer time is an important resource to consider.
