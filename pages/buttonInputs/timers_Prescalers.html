<h1> Timers </h1>

	
<h2>Timer Prescalers</h2>

<p>
    In short, <strong>prescalers</strong> let you configure how much 
    time passes between each timer tick, also known
    as the timer <strong>period</strong>. A bank of several prescalers
    are built into the processor, and each divides the
    <strong> master clock frequency</strong> by a specified amount.
    This allows you to select one prescaler that provides the best
    frequency for your timer.

                            </ul>

<h2>Selecting a Clock Source and Prescaler</h2>

<p>
    All timers use a
    <strong> timer source</strong> signal to
    tell them when to tick. This signal should
    be periodic, and should have 
    a frequency within safe minimum and maximum
    boundaries.
</p>

<p>
    Every time the source signal completes a cycle,
    the timer ticks once. Therefore, the frequency
    of the timer source signal, or <strong> timer
    source clock</strong>, determines the frequency
    of the timer, that is, how many ticks the timer
    will perform in a single second. 
</p>

<h3>Selecting Different Timer Source Clocks</h3>                      
  <p>
  Most microcontrollers
  let you configure the timer to source from 
  a few different places.
</p>

<p>
  You can select the same clock signal the
  processor is using, sometimes known
  as the master clock. Then, the timer 
  frequency will be the same as 
  the processor frequency.
<p/>

<p>
  Additionally, can choose to source the clock
  from an external pin. Then, you can wire a external
  oscillator onto the pin, selecting an oscillator
  that provides a more useful frequency.
  However, this adds more parts and more development
  time to the project.
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, you can select from several <strong>
  prescalers </strong> that are built into the processor.
  Each prescaler divides the master clock frequency down by
  a specified amount. This lets you pick a frequency
  that closer meets your needs.
  This option is cheaper than
  adding an external oscillator, and gives you more control
  than simply accepting the master clock frequency.

                            <p>
                            Data-sheet section 19.9.2 
                            on register TCCR0B, bits CS0.
                            Table 19-10 describes how to select different clock sources 
                            with the microcontroller on the Arduino Uno.
                            </p>
                            <h2> Possible Prescaler Output Frequencies </h2>
                            <p>
                               The frequency that comes out of a prescaler depends
                                on the Master Clock frequency that goes in. 
                                Consider the following table of outputs, using
                                a <strong> Master Clock Frequency of 1Mhz </strong>
                            </p>

                                the source clock frequency, the higher the resolution.

                            <p>
                                Say your system was programmed to measure the speed of
                                a baseball flying in front of its sensors.
                                Every timer tick, it takes a measurement of how
                                far the baseball has traveled from its previous position 
                                in the last tick.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the timer frequency is too high, too many ticks
                                will occur in a second. Either too 
                                may measurements will be made: wasting space and power.

                                If the timer frequency is too low, too few ticks
                                will occur in a second. We might not take enough
                                measurements of the ball while it passes in front
                                of the sensor.

                            <p>
                                It is in our best interests to find a timer frequency
                                that gives us the best possible resolution for our application.
