<h1> Introduction to Embedded Systems </h1>

<h2> What is an embedded system? </h2>

<p>
An embedded system is an 
<strong> application specific computer, </strong> 
built into another product or system. Sometimes known as
a microcomputer, microcontroller, or digital control system.

A <strong>application specific computer </strong> 
is different from a 
<strong> general application computer,</strong> 
which is what most 
people mean when they use the word computer.</p>

<p>
A <strong> general application computer </strong>
is a computer that can be used 
for many jobs. It can run a 
web browser, an email client, and
play games, all with little to no 
changes to hardware.
Laptops, Desktops, and smartphones
are all general purpose computers.
</p>

<p>
An <strong> application specific computer </strong>
is a computer designed to do one job, and to do it 
quicker, cheaper, or better than an application specific
computer could do it.
</p>

<p>
A digital traffic light control system, or 
vehicle control systems embedded in cars,
are both application specific computers,
and embedded systems.
The computer controlling an ATM, 
or a vending machine, is also an application
specific computer. The computer systems
inside these devices would also be considered
embedded systems.
</p>

<h3>When to Use a General Purpose Computer</h3>
<p> 
The goal for a general 
purpose computer is to be able
to run a wide range of software.
A general purpose computer uses a standard
operating system and generally
standard hardware to create 
an environment developers can quickly write
software for, and run on different kinds 
of computers with minimal fuss. 
</p>

<h3>Specific </h3>
<p>
An embedded system typically
uses custom hardware unique to
that product, and software written to
run on that device alone. A more specialized
design makes sacrifices to standardization, development time,
and design reuse, and gains higher operating speeds,
lower production costs,
smaller power footprint, or other factors.
</p>

<h3>Special</h3>
<p>
Specialization can be taken to an even greater extreme.
A team can choose to design a system with specialized hardware alone.
Instead of a processor loading software instructions, the entire
job is performed by circuits designed specifically for the task.
Usually, the circuit can be even be designed to do the 
job orders of magnitude faster than software could. 
It is entirely possible, for example, to make a circuit board that
let a user browse and watch YouTube videos on an attached
LDC touchscreen, without any software at all.
</p>

<p>
However, extreme specialization comes with costs.
Hardware is a lot harder to reprogram on the fly,
(try downloading some more RAM sometime),
more time consuming and expensive to 
develop, and more expensive to manufacture and distribute to customers.
A hardware-only YouTube viewer would take a large team of 
developers many years to make and would cost hundreds of 
dollars a viewer (while the cost of shipping 
software on the internet is negligible). 
And forget about security updates for viewers already
shipped. 
</p>

<p>
There is a reason most devices uses processors 
and software; Doing things
in hardware alone is exorbitantly expensive, 
and typically the gains to performance
aren't even needed.
</p>
	
<p>
These three categories make up a spectrum. Embedded Systems fall in the middle of the spectrum. The definition of an embedded system is slippery, and if a gizmo qualifies and can be argued in some cases. 
	</p>
	
	<!--
	Draw a spectrum
		
		pure electronics ? embedded system ? general purpose computer
		no processor	   processor, one or two programs	os      many programs

	Put different products on this spectrum
	-->
<p>
Embedded engineering is the design of systems that exist in the middle of this spectrum. Systems that use a combination of require circuits and software to be designed to work. 
</p>

<p>
Embedded circuits exist inside cars, medical equipment, manufacturing lines, home appliances, the list goes on for awhile.
</p>
	
<p>
Embedded designers have to juggle five different factors for any project. These priorities will have different weight depending on the project. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Those five factors are:
	</p>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Cost</li>
		<li>Speed	</li>
		<li>Real time constrains</li>
		<li>Reliability</li>
		<li>Power</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Cost</h2>
	
	<p>
	Embedded systems require parts. A processor, batteries, switches, resistors, and other parts all cost money. Each part may cost only a few cents apeice, but when you are manufacturing hundreds of thousands of gizmos, saving a few cents a unit makes a big difference. The other cost comes from software, licenses for using propriety libraries can cost money, but most important is developer time. It costs a lot to pay people to write code, it also costs a lot to pay people to maintain code. This is an important, and easily overlooked cost factor a designer must consider when first planning out a project. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Speed</h2>
	
	<p>
	Faster computers are always better, right? Not always. The speed of a computer is dependent upon a lot of factors, but mostly it comes down to processor clock speed. The clock speed determines how many instructions the computer performs per second, usually represented as hertz. (hz) Processors capable of faster clock speeds are usually more expensive, and typically use more electrical power (more on power later). 
	</p>

	<h2>Real Time Constraints</h2>
	
	<p>
	This factor is closely related to system speed. Real time constraints are events in the real world the embedded system must respond to within a specific time window. An red-light traffic camera is a good example. The system must detect when a car has run a red light and take at least one good photo the license plate before the car is out of view. It doesn’t always have to run fast enough to catch a speedster in its electronic sights, in fact, the majority of the time nothing will be happening at all. Sometimes, an Embedded Engineer needs to make sure the system can respond in real time to external events.
	</p>

<h2>Reliability</h2>
	
	<p>
	Software has bugs. And machines break. Any given situation has differing tolerances for computer and mechanical errors. If you are designing a space probe, that tolerance will be zero, or as close as you can manage. Getting that will be expensive. High quality electronic parts that are well sheilded against the intense radiation in space. Redundant systems for your redundant systems. For software you will need to make sure every edge case of the program is covered, the code has been reviewed by twenty sets of eyes. The program doesn’t crash even when its run twenty thousand times and it runs out of memory.  On the other hand, if you are designing a pen light, that caliber of reliability is completely unnecessary.
	</p>
	
<h2>Power</h2>
	
	<p>
	Some embedded systems run on battery power. And even when they don’t having a low power footprint can be an important requirement for the project. Picking an appropriate processor is an important step, ensuring its clock speed isn’t higher than necessary, and using its sleep mode when possible if it has one. Checking the power needs of other parts on the board, like sensors or network devices, is another step. 
	</p>

	<p>
	You will never be able to maximize all these factors equally. Most projects have a focus on two or three, with the remaining factors being less important. Knowing which of these factors your project prioritizes is important throughout designing and building an embedded system.
