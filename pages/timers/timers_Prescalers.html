<h1> Timers </h1>

	
<h2>Timer Prescalers</h2>

<p>
    In short, <strong>prescalers</strong> let you configure how much 
    time passes between each timer tick, also known
    as the timer <strong>period</strong>. A bank of several prescalers
    are built into the processor, and each divides the
    <strong> master clock frequency</strong> by a specified amount.
    This allows you to select one prescaler that provides the best
    frequency for your timer.

<h2> Quick Recap on Period and Frequency</h2>
<p>
    Remember that <strong> Period</strong> is
    a term used to measure anything periodic,
    or part of a repeating pattern. As a quick review,
    the basic terms describing periodic systems are:
 </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Period:</strong> Time between cycles</li>
                                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Number of cycles in a second, measured in Hertz (Hz)</li>
                            </ul>

<p>
    Also remember that Frequency is the inverse of the period.
    That is, the longer the time between cycles, the fewer cycles
    can take place in a second. This idea expressed in equation form is:
</p>

<div class="mathEquation">
    P = Period
    F = Frequency

    P = 1/F 
</div>

<h2>How Timer Period is Determined</h2>

<p>
    All timers use a
    <strong> timer source</strong> signal to
    tell them when to tick. This signal should
    be an oscillating signal, and should have 
    a frequency within safe minimum and maximum
    boundaries. (IE, The timer won't work if
    the source signal is too fast or too slow)
    Every time the source signal goes high,
    (or some other predefined stage in the cycle)
    the timer ticks once. Therefore, the frequency
    of the timer source signal, or <strong> timer
    source clock</strong>, determines the frequency
    of the timer, that is, how many ticks the timer
    will perform in a single second. 
</p>

      <h3>Selecting Different Timer Source Clocks</h3>                      
                            <p>Most microcontrollers
                            let you configure the timer to source from 
                            a few different places.</p>

                            <p>
                            You can select the clock signal the
                            processor in using, sometimes known
                            as the master clock.
                            Then, the timer frequency will be 
                                the same as the processor frequency.
                            <p/>
                            
                            <p> 
                                However, the frequency of the master
                                clock may not meet your needs. It may be
                                too fast, counting to the maximum counter
                                value (255 for the 8-bit counter), too
                                quickly to be useful in your application.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To fix this, you can choose to source the clock
                                from an external pin. Then, you can wire a external
                                oscillator onto the pin, selecting an oscillator
                                that provides a more useful frequency.
                                However, this adds more parts and more development
                                time to the project.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Lastly, you can select from several <strong>
                                prescalers </strong> that are built into the processor.
                                Each prescaler divides the master clock frequency down by
                                a specified amount. This lets you pick a frequency
                                that closer meets your needs.
                                This option is cheaper than
                                adding an external oscillator, and gives you more control
                                than simply accepting the master clock frequency.
                            </p>

                            Table 19-10 describes how to select different clock sources

                            <p>
                               The frequency that comes out of a prescaler depends
                                on the Master Clock frequency that goes in. 
                                Consider the following table of outputs, using
                                a <strong> Master Clock Frequency of 1Mhz </strong>

                                Why Bother Adjusting the Timer Frequency.
                            </h2>

                            <p>
                                The timer frequency directly controls the timer 
                                <strong>Resolution</strong>, or how granular a
                                chunk of time the timer can measure. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Say your system was programmed to measure the 
                                a baseball flying in front of its sensors.
                                Every timer tick, it is programmed to measure how
                                far the baseball has traveled from its previous position 
                                in the last tick.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the timer frequency is too high, too many ticks
                                will occur in a second. Either too 
                                may measurements will be made (which would be 
                                inconvenient and perhaps waste power on unneeded 
                                sensor reads), or the timer will roll over before
                                the ball has left the sensors field of view
                                (which could really foul things up)
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the timer frequency is too low, too few ticks
                                will occur in a second. We might not take enough
                                measurements of the ball while it passes in front
                                of the sensor. If timer is really slow, we 
                                may miss the ball entirely, as
                                the ball passed by between ticks. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It is in our best interests to find a timer frequency
                                that gives us the best possible resolution for our application.
